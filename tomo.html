            <h3>Problem statement</h3>
            <p>As remote work gets more and more widespread every day, time management is more important than ever; yet the current time management and productivity tools still face the following problems, resulting in a poorer user experience than users want and deserve:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="circle-li">1</span><span class="emp-text">Proper time management became a task on its own.</span></li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">2</span>When sh*t happens (it always happens), it is very tedious to re-make your schedule, and</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">3</span>Time management tools work for your tasks, not for you.</li>

            <h1>Research</h1>

        <div class="case-study-content">
            <h3>Preliminary user interviews</h3>

            <p>I have kicked off this project with preliminary users interviews with the following goals:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><span class="circle-li">1</span>To understand how people manage their time,</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">2</span>To learn what tools they use, and how they use them,</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">3</span>To learn about the problems they encounter, and</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">4</span>To understand what their ideal time management tool would be like.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>During this research phase, I had <span class="emp-text">three very lengthy user interviews</span> and several relatively short interviews.</p>

            <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
            
            <p>As I had planned to run a solo design sprint of two weeks from zero to the first complete prototype, and I was satisfied with the outcome of my preliminary interviews, I decided to spend the rest of the time allocated for research on extensive competitive analysis.</p>

            <p>The purposes of this competitive analysis were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="circle-li">1</span>To understand the common layout patterns they use,</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">2</span>To learn what features users of time management tools look for,</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">3</span>To learn more about people's current problems with their time management, and </li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">4</span>To see what solutions were proposed for those common problems and how the problems I had learned about during the preliminary user interviews are attempted to be solved. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>During this extensive competitive analysis study, I have checked almost every single productivity, time management, to-do list, etc. product on ProductHunt and Google Play Store to understand the landscape. Among the crowd, those that deserve at least honorable mentions are <a href="https://www.any.do">Any.do</a>,<a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a>, <a href="https://todo.microsoft.com/">Microsoft To Do</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a>, <a href="https://reclaim.ai/">Reclaim.ai</a>, and <a href="https://untime.io/">Untime</a>.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="case-study-content">

            <h3>Key learnings from competitive analysis</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="circle-li">1</span>All time management tools ignore the fact that sh*t happens.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">2</span>Making your daily schedule truly became a task on its own.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">3</span>Most time management tools create a cognitive overload on their users.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">4</span><span class="emp-text">Most time management tools use very similar user interfaces.</span></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Just after I had completed the first iteration of Tomo's prototype, I had a chance to have a discussion with the CEO of quite a successful time management product that is about to launch a new product. Upon taking a look at the prototype I designed, they told me...</p>

            <q>"Because in my experience getting people to use new productivity apps is really hard and having a completely different interface than to what they are used to, makes it harder"</q>

    <section class="so-what-now" id="so-what-now">

        <h1>So, what now?</h1>

        <p>Based on my research, I have concluded that a time management product that I would be designing ought...</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="circle-li">1</span>to make the user's schedule based on their energy levels and moods,</li>
            <li><span class="circle-li">2</span>to be extremely easy to use and reduce the time spent on time management significantly,</li>
            <li><span class="circle-li">3</span>to allow the user to (re-)make their schedule based on their input with only a few clicks,</li>
            <li><span class="circle-li">4</span>to be there for the user when sh*t happens,</li>
            <li><span class="circle-li">5</span>not to clutter the user's mind with information unnecessary at any time, and</li>
            <li><span class="circle-li">6</span>to allow the user to focus on "one task at a time".</li>

        </ul>

        <div class="case-study-content">

            <h3>Automatic dynamic scheduling enters!</h3>

            <p>While conducting competitive analysis, I had come across some products with partially automated schedule making (e.g., <a href="https://www.reclaim.ai">Reclaim.ai</a>), but <span class="emp-text">I noticed that they were not making the best use of a feature with a business opportunity with immense value.</span></p>

            <p>After a brainstorming process, I have come up with a task prioritization and sorting algorithm, computationally so simple, that even a beginner like me can code, which I call <span class="emp-text">Automated Dynamic Scheduling.</span></p>

            <p>The algorithm re-queues user tasks based on user inputs (task actions, energy level, task categories) and task properties (due date and time, priority, and appx. time to complete), and further, this can be achieved only with a few clicks, any time the user wants.</p>

            <p>In cases where the algorithm has only partial information, the product would prompt the user, asking them to choose between equal options.</p>

            <p><span class="emp-text">So, the user would focus only on the current task which is the highest priority task with the closest deadline, and would not be prompted by Tomo unless there is an absolute necessity, e.g., they will miss a deadline for another task if they do not complete their current task shortly.</span></p>

            <q>"A to-do list with just one task on it reflects a strategic and intentional choice about what you will do next, and continue to focus on until it’s done. It might feel silly, but writing that one thing down on its own list is the key—it makes it a commitment that you’re far more likely to follow through on. Make meaningful progress, one task at a time." - Peter Bregman</q>

            <h3>Usability test</h3>

            <p>After I had completed Tomo's first prototype at the end of my two-week solo design sprint, it was finally time to test it with users, so the following questions in my mind would be answered. So, I conducted an online unmoderated usability test in which six participants would complete six tasks and answer two additional questions. The tasks they were asked to complete are as follows.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="circle-li">1</span>How easy or hard is it to complete the most common actions of the app?</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">2</span>Given Tomo has a different interface than most similar products per its functionality, how well or poorly would users find it?</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">3</span>Which of the two different "daily onboarding" flows would users prefer?</li>
            </ul>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Task</th>
                    <th>Avg. Duration</th>
                    <th>Avg. Score</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Let Tomo know how you feel and pick task categories to work on.</td>
                    <td>81.45 seconds</td>
                    <td>3.33/5.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Complete this daily onboarding flow.</td>
                    <td>30.70 seconds</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Check Tomo's suggestion and take an action.</td>
                    <td>96.14 seconds</td>
                    <td>4.16/5.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Delete your current task.</td>
                    <td>16.44 seconds</td>
                    <td>4.50/5.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Check a future task.</td>
                    <td>28.51 seconds</td>
                    <td>4.66/5.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Mark a future task as completed on List View.</td>
                    <td>40.73 seconds</td>
                    <td>4.50/5.00</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>At the end of the usability test, each test participant was asked if they had any suggestions or feedback regarding their experience using Tomo, and some were kind enough to provide several actionable items.</p>

            <h3>A/B testing two flows</h3>

            <p><span class="emp-text">As I was not able to decide between two "daily onboarding" flows, the most important insight that I was looking for from this usability test was the test participants' choices on them:</span>(i) which one they would rate higher (or lower), (ii) which one they would state to prefer, and (iii) which one they would take shorter (or longer) to complete.</p>
