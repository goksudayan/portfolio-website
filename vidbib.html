            <h3>Problem statement</h3>
            <p>One of the worst inefficiencies in the world is hiring processes that end with candidates' rejection: <span class="emp-text">Companies use very valuable resources, which they get zero return on investment, and most of the time, candidates get no feedback and spend their time in very repetitive interviews.</span></p>

            <img src="assets/vidbib-rejection-email.webp" alt="">

            <p>Case in point: Even for positions in which the candidate was under-experienced clearly as a day, no feedback or no specific reason for rejection is presented.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="case-study-content">
            
            <h3>Solution</h3>

            <img src="assets/vidbib-roles.svg" alt="">

            <p>Introducing external evaluators, a new role to the standard hiring equation: They evaluate job seekers' application packages and create extensive reports on them. These reports are shared with job seekers; thus they finally get feedback that they have been looking for for a long time and can be shared with the hiring responsible in the companies that are interested in the job seeker in return for financial compensation.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, companies that evaluated a candidate and spent valuable resources in the process can assume the role of external evaluators, and monetize their own evaluation reports, which enable them to get a return on their investment.
            Last but not least, any company purchasing such reports can significantly reduce the time and resources they spend on hiring processes.</p>

            <h1>Research</h1>

        <div class="case-study-content">
            <h3>Preliminary user interviews</h3>

            <p>To understand the problems job seekers face before, during, and after the hiring processes they go through, I interviewed two people who were actively looking for a job and had interviewed within the last thirty days.</p>

            <p>Both stated that:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="circle-li">1</span>Most interviews they participated in were highly repetitive.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">2</span>They barely get feedback from companies they are rejected from.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">3</span>They would love to get feedback.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">4</span>They believe such feedback would help them to do much better in future interviews.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="case-study-content">
            <h3>Questionnaires</h3>

            <p>To reach a broader population to verify these statements, see what other problems job seekers face, and understand the landscape better, I decided to conduct user questionnaires.</p>

            <p><span class="emp-text">One questionnaire for juniors and active job seekers with less than three years of experience and another for seniors with hiring responsibilities with at least three years of experience were prepared. In total, 34 questions were asked, and 9 individuals participated.</span></p>

        </div>

        <div class="case-study-content">
            <h3>Key learnings from questionnaires</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="circle-li">1</span>Job seekers truly care about feedback on their application packages and interviews.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">2</span>Some job seekers find it tedious to record long answers to one-way interview questions.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">3</span>A very high percentage of participants (85.7%) prefers using their computers for one-way interviews.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">4</span>Job seekers prefer to tailor their application packages per company as different companies value different things.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">5</span>Most seniors with hiring responsibilities would provide feedback if they had enough resources and time.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">6</span>Job seekers and hiring responsible have a much higher preference for one-way interviews.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="case-study-content">
            <h3>Eureka!</h3>

            <p>Back to the whiteboard, I decided to go over four key points I learned by then:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="circle-li">1</span>There is a market (i.e., supply and demand) for career consultancy services.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">2</span>Seniors and companies would provide feedback if they had enough resources or had been incentivized strongly.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">3</span>Job seekers love feedback on their application packages.</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">4</span>A hiring process that ends with the rejection of a candidate to whom no feedback is provided is extremely inefficient.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>During a brainstorming session, I noticed that a new role, “external evaluator”, could be introduced to the standard hiring equation between job seekers and companies, immensely improving the current hiring practices.</p>

            <img src="assets/vidbib-roles-02.svg" alt="">

            <p><span class="emp-text">An external evaluator would provide extensive feedback on a job seeker's application package and get financially compensated for their time and effort. A job seeker would get extensive feedback, by allowing the external evaluator to share and monetize the extensive report they create, and companies would be able to purchase these reports, significantly reducing the resources they spend on job candidates, and/or sell their own reports on candidates they had rejected.</span></p>

            <p>Most importantly, any person can assume any combination of these three roles under certain circumstances.</p>

            <p>As an outcome of this new hiring process, job seekers' interviews become less repetitive, they get more feedback, hand-selected pioneers of their fields can provide feedback to job seekers and monetize their efforts, and companies finally have a way to “recycle” their efforts and reports on rejected candidates.</p>

            <h3>Usability test</h3>

            <p>After I completed the first iteration of VidBib’s prototype, it was time to test it with some real users. Yet, <span class="emp-text">in addition to testing its usability, I had another motivation: To see how fast users learn to navigate through the website.</span></p>

            <p>Even though I had done quite a good job with its information architecture, some power users would be switching between three roles constantly and very swiftly, thus how intuitive they find navigating through the product was very important.</p>

            <p>With these two goals in my mind, I conducted <span class="emp-text">an online unmoderated usability test</span> with four tasks. All users were shortly briefed about VidBib before they started their tests, and as any task would start at the hiring responsible dashboard, instead of the product homepage where they could read about the roles, and the business proposition VidBib presents, etc., they would know very little about roles. While this is not clearly ideal for first-time users, this was intended to observe how fast they learn to navigate through the website, even when they have minimal information.</p>

            <p><span class="emp-text">In fact, the two tasks, Task 1 and Task 3 were almost identical in terms of navigation, and to ensure they are not sequential, the longest task of this usability task was put between them. Any decrease in their average duration to complete those two tasks and any increase in their average scores would imply that VidBib's navigation is truly intuitive and very easy to learn through.</span></p>

            <p>Companies and candidates can use VidBib as a one-way interview platform. Pre-answers enable candidates to create their own pages, as below, review their answers, and share them with external evaluators, and companies to review those answers and write (and share) their comments on them.</p>

            <p>Job seekers can share introduction videos, and "pre-answers" to interview questions publicly on their personal pages. Sharing those pages with the hiring responsible significantly reduces the time spend on pre-screening calls, or even interviews.</p>
