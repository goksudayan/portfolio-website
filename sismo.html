            <h3>Product introduction</h3>

            <p>Scope — Partially collaborative design exercise</p>
            <p>Context — Interactive prototype of a web app</p>
            <p>Timeframe — Dec 2022</p>
            <p>Links — <a href="https://www.sismo.io">Product website</a></p>


            <p>As a part of a partially collaborative design exercise with <a href="https://www.sismo.io">Sismo</a>, a Web3 product that focuses on digital identity and privacy-preserving solutions, I was given a prompt to provide an interactive prototype of how their app's next version, Sismo App v2, would look like.</p>

            <p> At the very beginning of this assignment, I decided on three general design principles:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="circle-li">1</span>The continuity of the user flow is to be signaled by both functionality and visuals,</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">2</span>With this version, the Sismo app would move from a one-directional product to a multi-directional product. This means that users would be able to interact with elements as many as they desire, without any limitations, at any point in their user experience, and</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">3</span>Considering the landscape and Sismo's plans for the future, design scalability is to be taken into consideration with every single design decision.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="case-study-content">
            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <p>The primary objectives of this collaboration were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="circle-li">1</span>Merging the Playground and Curated environments into the same environment (i.e., merging two different user flows into one single user flow),</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">2</span>Making the app's user experience much more interactive,</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">3</span>Displaying what badges the user is eligible for, and</li>
                <li><span class="circle-li">4</span>Displaying badge data in a user-friendly way.</li>

            <h3>Design system</h3>

            <p>Even though I was provided a very light design system with few components, it was extremely limited, especially considering the scope of this assignment (an upgrade of the app, not only in terms of design but also in terms of functionality) and the very little time I had provided to complete it (one week, to be exact).</p>

            <p>As I have noticed that most of my time working on this assignment would be spent on creating a much more extensive design system to ensure that the time spent on design is reduced and that a more efficient handoff at the end would be ensured; I have started to work on a design system, so minimal that no components of that I would not use for this assignment would not be created at the first place.</p>

            <h3>Badge view</h3>

            <p>It is accurate to say that Badges are atomic units of the whole Sismo product, and the way badge information is displayed is truly important for the ideal user experience.</p>

            <p>When a user clicks on a badge on the current app, v1, a new page that displays the badge's information opens. As one of the core design principles I chose to follow for this assignment is to ensure the continuity of user experience, so that unless necessary, it is not disrupted, I have decided to make use of overlays to give users the sensation of a one-page app.</p>

            <p>In fact, <span class="emp-text">I strongly considered going even further and adding a tab view as below. The purpose of this tab view would be (1) to improve this continuity even further, and (2) to obtain a higher level of design scalability.</span> Yet, per the team's feedback, we gave up on this idea; though, I personally still think that it is an idea at least worth exploring.</p>

            <h3>New main page</h3>

            <p>I was asked to design a new main page: Per the prompt, this page would have a table view consisting of two different kinds of badges, Curated, and Non-Curated ones, which had their own different user flows in two different environments. In addition, some statistics considering these badges and new interactions, such as selecting multiple badges, hover states, etc., were added to improve this page's visual design and functionality.</p>

            <p>As the current version of the Sismo app does not allow its users to interact with multiple elements, one of the highest priority tasks was to create a delightful experience that enables users to interact with multiple elements, including selecting multiple badges and minting them only with a few clicks.</p>

            <h>Slack app</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-content">
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>After a quick onboarding that brought me up to speed, getting me to know about the issues that the product was facing at the time, the Head of Product and I conducted several brainstorming sessions to decide on the best medium to test the product-market fit and primary/secondary features.</p>
            <p><span class="emp-text">We concluded that a Slack app would be the ideal medium as it is easy to prototype, it is relatively quick to develop, and, most importantly, most of our target audience would use Slack as part of their professional life regularly.
            </span></p>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-content">
            <h3>Two forms of availability</h3>
            <img src="assets/katch-forms-of-availability.webp">
            <p>Around the time we had just started working on this Slack app, we considered two different forms of availability that I called "local availability" and "global availability".</p>
            <p><span class="emp-text">Local availability</span>: A person would be locally available when they signal that they are available to the people who sent meeting requests at a prior date or to a pre-selected group of people. This could be called "selective availability" as well.</p>
            <p><span class="emp-text">Global availability</span>: A person would be globally available when they signal that they are available to everyone. This could be called "unselective availability" as well.</p>
            <p>The reason why we considered this concept of local availability was that in some very large companies, signaling that you are (globally) available to everyone on your Slack channel means that hundreds of people would be able to request meetings, making it extremely hard for the user to maintain.</p>
            <p>For reasons that I was not informed of at the time, we were asked to quit working on the Slack app and move to work on the iOS app that the company was already developing at the time I joined.</p>

    <section class="page-section" id="ios-app">
        <p>Shortly after, per some changes in the company's short-term plan, the executive team set a date for <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/katch" target="_blank">a Product Hunt launch</a> and to make sure that we do not miss the deadline, <span class="emp-text">we had to work in a very agile manner</span>, redesigning primary features and preparing/ explaining handoffs to engineers in an almost bi-daily manner to complete the Katch iOS app.
            
        <p>As my seniors were worried that the product was bloated with many features, the Head of Product and I were asked to work on and re-design some hand-picked features that were considered necessary for the optimal user experience. Those three key features were:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="circle-li">1</span>Setting up Availability Hours,</li>
            <li><span class="circle-li">2</span>Marking Katch cards as done and sending notifications after the call, and</li>
            <li><span class="circle-li">3</span>Sending meeting requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Availability Hours</h3>

        <div class="feature-section">

            <img src="assets/katch-availability-hours.webp" alt="">


            <div class="feature-description">
                <p>"Availability Hours" is a feature that helps the user to get more timely reminder notifications from the Katch iOS app. During those availability hours, a user gets notifications, reminding them to get in touch with another user who sent a meeting request at a prior date and time.</p>
                <p>A previous version of the Katch iOS app allowed the user to turn on and off this feature, however, as we noticed that thanks to the new user flow, the user would be getting such reminder notifications anyway, we decided to make it a permanent feature that the user cannot toggle off.</p>
                <p>Yet, in case the user did not grant notifications permission, this feature would not work at all: If the user does not get any notifications, which we consider to be necessary for the ideal user experience, then they cannot get those reminder notifications as well. So, what greets a user when they open the availability hours screen was a popup, asking the user to grant notifications permission to proceed.</p>
            </div>

        </div>

        <h3>Marking as Done</h3>

        <div class="feature-section">

            <img src="assets/katch-marking-as-done.gif" alt="">

            <div class="feature-description">
                <p>To make sure the user interface is not bloated with the meeting request cards that are completed, we decided to add some kind of visual element so that the user can remove selected Katch cards from their display.</p>
                <p>After a very lengthy discussion, we decided to use checkboxes to enable users to select and remove Katch cards from their displays. Even though I voiced my extreme displeasure with this visual design decision strongly many times, as we had to move quickly to the other features, we still went with this decision.</p>
                <p><span class="emp-text">Some of the reasons why I was so displeased with it are (1) checkboxes commonly are not used for this function (opening an overlay), so users would click those checkboxes, expecting to select Katch cards, not to open some overlay, and (2) the home screen layout loses its consistent alignment.</span></p>
